Hi! My name is Nick Erwin and I am an aspiring front-end/UI/UX developer based in Charlotte, NC. I began with computers around the age of 8, when I first taught myself to
reverse-engineer and modify PC games. 

I went to the University of North Carolina at Charlotte and got my Bachelor's in finance. I have always loved business, investing, and now I am trying to come full-circle
with my computer skills in programming. I am certified mastery level across the Microsoft Office Suite, and have experience with Moqups, Microsoft PowerBI, and Access databasing. 

Feel free to reach out to me at nickerwin83@yahoo.com or my LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholas-erwin-07623baa/) if you would like to collaborate!
